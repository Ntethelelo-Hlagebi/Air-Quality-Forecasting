AirQo Ugandan Air Quality Forecast Challenge The objective of this challenge is to predict the air quality level at exactly 24 hours after a 5-day series of hourly weather data readings which include temperature, rainfall, wind, and humidity.So here we're going to empoy ANN methods to tacle this challenge by developing 2 ANN models. The first model is developed based on LSTM architecture, and the second model is developed based on CNN architecture. For both models the performance is measured using RMSE and Mean Square Error (MSE) loss.
